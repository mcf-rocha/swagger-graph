# swagger-graph
Generates a graph visualisation from Paths in swagger-based RESTful APIs definitions.


## What is it for?
During API maintenance or evolution, Architects and API developers might loose track of the existing resources and path parameters.
Keeping the defined API standards is a challenging task if one has either dozens of APIs and/or hundread of methods and paths.
A graph visualization of how all API's URLs are structured, with an user friendly view of all resources and path parameters, helps Architects to make better decisions.


## How it works?
1. Import from a repository to a database all APIs definitions. We call it "Ingestion";
    * Note 1: Currently only SVN (repository) and MongoDB (database) is supported;
    * Note 2: It' assumed you have them installed.
2. Traverse all Paths from an API in the database and generate a graph such as the one below.
    * Note: Graph generation is done using GraphViz (http://www.graphviz.org), which is assumed it is installed.

## How graphs look like?

Blue nodes represent API resources. Dashed nodes are path parameters.
Each Swagger API is presented with a clear gray background.

Colors can be easily customized.
